# Python
Octgn uses IronPython for its in-game scripting engine.

The python definitions go in [PythonApi.py](https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN/blob/master/octgnFX/Octgn/Scripting/PythonAPI.py). You can call outside code with the following syntax:  _api.function_name and it will call the corresponding function in [ScriptApi.cs](https://github.com/kellyelton/OCTGN/blob/master/octgnFX/Octgn/Scripting/ScriptAPI.cs).
For example, the following code found in [PythonApi.py](https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN/blob/master/octgnFX/Octgn/Scripting/PythonAPI.py) is the random function:
```
def rnd(min, max):
  return _api.Random(min, max)
```

It calls Random with a min and max value that is located in [ScriptApi.cs](https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN/blob/master/octgnFX/Octgn/Scripting/ScriptAPI.cs).

# octgnFX/Octgn.Data
Octgn.Data is the access to the database (mostly). This project provides access to that data in meaningful formats. Most of the items in this project are relatively self-explanatory, but keep in mind that many of them are only the data counterparts of octgnFX/Octgn classes.

Some of the classes do not (as of yet) have direct connections to the database. Deck.cs is a prime example. Currently all decks are stored/accessed as individual files with the user determining name and location.
