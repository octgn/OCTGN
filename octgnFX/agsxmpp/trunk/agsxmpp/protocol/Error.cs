        RFC 4.7.3.  Defined Conditions

        The following stream-level error conditions are defined:

        * <bad-format/> -- the entity has sent XML that cannot be processed; this error MAY be used instead of the more specific XML-related errors, such as <bad-namespace-prefix/>, <invalid-xml/>, <restricted-xml/>, <unsupported-encoding/>, and <xml-not-well-formed/>, although the more specific errors are preferred.
        * <bad-namespace-prefix/> -- the entity has sent a namespace prefix that is unsupported, or has sent no namespace prefix on an element that requires such a prefix (see XML Namespace Names and Prefixes (XML Namespace Names and Prefixes)).
        * <conflict/> -- the server is closing the active stream for this entity because a new stream has been initiated that conflicts with the existing stream.
        * <connection-timeout/> -- the entity has not generated any traffic over the stream for some period of time (configurable according to a local service policy).
        * <host-gone/> -- the value of the 'to' attribute provided by the initiating entity in the stream header corresponds to a hostname that is no longer hosted by the server.
        * <host-unknown/> -- the value of the 'to' attribute provided by the initiating entity in the stream header does not correspond to a hostname that is hosted by the server.
        * <improper-addressing/> -- a stanza sent between two servers lacks a 'to' or 'from' attribute (or the attribute has no value).
        * <internal-server-error/> -- the server has experienced a misconfiguration or an otherwise-undefined internal error that prevents it from servicing the stream.
        * <invalid-from/> -- the JID or hostname provided in a 'from' address does not match an authorized JID or validated domain negotiated between servers via SASL or dialback, or between a client and a server via authentication and resource binding.
        * <invalid-id/> -- the stream ID or dialback ID is invalid or does not match an ID previously provided.
        * <invalid-namespace/> -- the streams namespace name is something other than "http://etherx.jabber.org/streams" or the dialback namespace name is something other than "jabber:server:dialback" (see XML Namespace Names and Prefixes (XML Namespace Names and Prefixes)).
        * <invalid-xml/> -- the entity has sent invalid XML over the stream to a server that performs validation (see Validation (Validation)).
        * <not-authorized/> -- the entity has attempted to send data before the stream has been authenticated, or otherwise is not authorized to perform an action related to stream negotiation; the receiving entity MUST NOT process the offending stanza before sending the stream error.
        * <policy-violation/> -- the entity has violated some local service policy; the server MAY choose to specify the policy in the <text/> element or an application-specific condition element.
        * <remote-connection-failed/> -- the server is unable to properly connect to a remote entity that is required for authentication or authorization.
        * <resource-constraint/> -- the server lacks the system resources necessary to service the stream.
        * <restricted-xml/> -- the entity has attempted to send restricted XML features such as a comment, processing instruction, DTD, entity reference, or unescaped character (see Restrictions (Restrictions)).
        * <see-other-host/> -- the server will not provide service to the initiating entity but is redirecting traffic to another host; the server SHOULD specify the alternate hostname or IP address (which MUST be a valid domain identifier) as the XML character data of the <see-other-host/> element.
        * <system-shutdown/> -- the server is being shut down and all active streams are being closed.
        * <undefined-condition/> -- the error condition is not one of those defined by the other conditions in this list; this error condition SHOULD be used only in conjunction with an application-specific condition.
        * <unsupported-encoding/> -- the initiating entity has encoded the stream in an encoding that is not supported by the server (see Character Encoding (Character Encoding)).
        * <unsupported-stanza-type/> -- the initiating entity has sent a first-level child of the stream that is not supported by the server.
        * <unsupported-version/> -- the value of the 'version' attribute provided by the initiating entity in the stream header specifies a version of XMPP that is not supported by the server; the server MAY specify the version(s) it supports in the <text/> element.
        * <xml-not-well-formed/> -- the initiating entity has sent XML that is not well-formed as defined by [XML] (Bray, T., Paoli, J., Sperberg-McQueen, C., and E. Maler, “Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (2nd ed),” October 2000.).
