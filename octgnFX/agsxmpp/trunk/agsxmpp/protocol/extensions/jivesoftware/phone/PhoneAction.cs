         * Actions are sent by the client to perform tasks such as dialing, checking for messages, etc. Actions are sent as IQ's (type set), as with the following child stanza:
         * 
         * <phone-action xmlns="http://jivesoftware.com/xmlns/phone" type="DIAL">
         *    <extension>5035555555</extension>
         * </phone-action>
         *          
         * Currently supported types are DIAL and FORWARD.
         * In most implementations, issuing a dial command will cause the user's phone to ring.
         * Once the user picks up, the specified extension will be dialed.
         * 
         * Dialing can also be performed by jid too. The jid must be dialed must be mapped on the server to an extension
         * 
         * <phone-action type="DIAL">
         *  <jid>andrew@jivesoftware.com</jid>
         * </phone-action>
         * 
         * Issuing a action wth a type FORWARD should transfer a call that has already been 
         * established to a third party. The FORWARD type requires an extension or jid child element
         *
         *  <phone-action xmlns="http://jivesoftware.com/xmlns/phone" type="FORWARD">
         *      <extension>5035555555</extension>
