OverrideCardsMoved event now passes faceups argument indicating the faceup end-status of the card (if the user held shift to play the card facedown, etc) 
queryCard python 3.1.0.2 API will return a list of GUIDs matching card filter parameters (same parameters as askCard)
fixed being unable to get GUIDs of facedown cards in 3.1.0.2 API
