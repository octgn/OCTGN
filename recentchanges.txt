OverrideCardsMoved event now passes faceups argument indicating the faceup end-status of the card (if the user held shift to play the card facedown, etc) 
queryCard python 3.1.0.2 API will return a list of GUIDs matching card filter parameters (same parameters as askCard)
fixed being unable to get GUIDs of facedown cards in 3.1.0.2 API
stops set on future phases in the turn will be triggered when a player tries to pass the turn
Added python API commands to control the turn player and turn number
Games can have a greater amount of control over turn structure using events and overrides
Fixed a visual bug involving the play/pause turn buttons on the player tab
