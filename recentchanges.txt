Added support for multiple game boards
3.2.0.2 API for changing game boards is now table.board (get/set)
changing game boards networks to all players
game boards aren't associated with the table group anymore in the XML.
Made sure compatibility isn't broken with games that still use the old method of declaring boards inside the <table> tag.
