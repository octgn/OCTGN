OverrideCardsMoved event now passes faceups argument indicating the faceup end-status of the card (if the user held shift to play the card facedown, etc)
queryCard python 3.1.0.2 API will return a list of GUIDs matching card filter parameters (same parameters as askCard)
fixed being unable to get GUIDs of facedown cards in 3.1.0.2 API

Support for advanced text formatting for set XML property values
- Added Symbol definition to Game XML for icons (replaces need to use custom fonts for icons)
- Added in-line support for bold/italic/colored fonts, and symbol icons, in card property values (only appears in deck editor)
