Card Name now a standard property within the PropertySet, no longer deserialized as a custom property.
Card names can be filtered in deck editor searches.
Cleaned up how OCTGN manages card alternate properties and inheritance
Added a few extension methods to manage fetching card property sets
Moved booster pack generator code into the Octgn.Core library's Pack Extension Methods
Markers are now defined in the game's XML definition. Existing games with set xml markers will still work, but o8build will enforce game-only markers for new packages.
XML format for game markers: <marker name="Damage Counter" id="damage" src="Markers/damage.png">
Re-structuring of some proxy generator files, with some undiscoverd bug fixes.
Proxy templates can now theoretically support nested conditional elements
Default Game Board and Card Size can now accept an optional name (defaults to 'Default')
Significant changes to the IDE (OCTGN game editor), not quite finished yet but it is relatively stable
